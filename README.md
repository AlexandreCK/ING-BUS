# ING-BUS

## ABOUT THE PROJECT:

We're on a mission to reduce our data storage footprint and CO2 emissions at ING! Did you know that permanently deleting just 7 emails can make a difference equivalent to driving 1 kilometer less in a diesel car? 
That"s why we're creating a fun and engaging way to raise awareness about email cleanup among ING colleagues across the Netherlands. 
Join us on a virtual bus ride as it travels past ING offices in major cities, filling up with permanently deleted emails and getting greener with every stop. 
The more emails we delete together, the faster our bus travels!
